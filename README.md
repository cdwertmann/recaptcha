Recaptcha Redmine 2.x plugin
===========================

Redmine 5.x plugin that adds a recaptcha to the account registration page.

- Installation: just clone it to your plugins directory, run 'bundle' and restart Redmine.
- Configuration: on the plugin setting page, enter your recaptcha keypair.
- Compatibility: tested with Redmine 5.0.4, but I assume it works with older versions as well.
